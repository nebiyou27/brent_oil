## Project Overview

The Brent Oil Price Analysis Dashboard is designed to analyze Brent oil prices, identify influencing factors, and provide an interactive visualization tool. The project consists of three main tasks:

1. **Data Analysis Workflow and Understanding the Model and Data**
2. **Analysis and Modeling of Brent Oil Prices**
3. **Interactive Dashboard Development**

## Task 1: Data Analysis Workflow and Understanding the Model and Data

### Defining the Data Analysis Workflow

#### Objective
To establish a structured approach for analyzing Brent oil prices.

#### Steps:
- Define the analysis process and methodology.
- Understand data generation, sampling, and compilation.
- Identify model inputs, parameters, and outputs.
- Clarify assumptions and limitations.
- Determine communication channels for presenting results.

#### Understanding the Model and Data
- Review literature and references to understand key concepts and models.
- Study time series analysis models (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH) and their application.
- Identify data sources and generation processes.
- Define expected outputs and limitations.

## Task 2: Analysis and Modeling of Brent Oil Prices

### Analysis of Brent Oil Prices

#### Objective
To apply analytical methods to historical Brent oil price data.

#### Methodology
- Utilize time series analysis models (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH, VAR, Markov-Switching ARIMA).
- Implement machine learning models (e.g., LSTM) for pattern recognition.
- Analyze economic, technological, and political factors affecting prices:
  - Economic Indicators: GDP, inflation, unemployment, exchange rates.
  - Technological Changes: Extraction methods, renewable energy adoption.
  - Political and Regulatory Factors: Trade policies, environmental regulations.

### Adapting the Model to New Scenarios

#### Objective
To extend the analysis framework to different scenarios and datasets.

#### Methodology
- Apply analysis to other commodities (e.g., natural gas, coal).
- Integrate new variables and data sources.
- Validate models using backtesting, out-of-sample testing, and cross-validation.

### Suggested Approach

#### Data Collection
- Gather data from World Bank, IMF, IEA, and industry reports.

#### Data Preprocessing
- Clean and preprocess data, handle missing values and outliers.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify patterns, trends, and relationships via visualizations.

#### Model Building
- Develop multiple models: time series, econometric, machine learning.

#### Model Evaluation
- Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, R-squared.

#### Insight Generation
- Interpret model outputs and provide recommendations.

## Task 3: Developing an Interactive Dashboard

### Dashboard Application

#### Objective
To develop an interactive dashboard for data visualization.

#### Technologies
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** React (JavaScript)
- **Chart Libraries:** Recharts, D3.js, or others

#### Key Components

##### Backend (Flask)
- Develop APIs for serving analysis data.
- Handle dataset requests, model outputs, and metrics.
- Integrate data sources for real-time updates (optional).

##### Frontend (React)
- Build an intuitive user interface.
- Design interactive visualizations showing trends and correlations.
- Implement filtering, date ranges, and comparisons.
- Ensure responsiveness across devices.

#### Key Features
- Display historical trends, forecasts, and correlations.
- Highlight major events impacting oil prices.
- Provide data filtering and drill-down capabilities.
- Show key indicators (volatility, price changes, model accuracy).

## Installation and Setup

### Backend (Flask)

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the environment:
   - Windows:
     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the Flask app:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend (React)

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React app:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- Access the dashboard in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Navigate through the sections (Dashboard, Historical Analysis, Forecast, Model Performance, Events).
- Interact with visualizations and filters to analyze the data.
